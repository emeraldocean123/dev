# Legacy Session Summaries

Session recaps stored here are preserved exactly as they were captured (long
headings, raw CLI snippets, etc.). They remain out of markdownlint scope so the
original investigative context is not lost. New session summaries should live at
`reports/` and follow the curated style guide.***
